  Wellington sites and activities
  Your guide to the best things to see and do in the coolest little capital.
  Wellington is a city where having fun is easy. You can meet meerkats, kiwis and cave trolls on the same day. Paddle on the harbour in the morning, mountain bike in the afternoon. Galleries for breakfast, museums for lunch and theatre for dinner.
